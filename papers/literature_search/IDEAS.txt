Ideas for Paper:

Characterize how well RFID works outdoors on an AUV with the broader application of:
	- using long range RFID for bridge analysis using remote sensing
	- parking lot inspection
	- the warehouse inventory problem outdoors instead of in a confined environment. 

Look at:
	- doppler shift
	- read angles
	- mounting
	- read success as a function x, y, z
	- interference
	- What is possible

RFID Doppler Shift

Make blank graphs I hope to fill in

Could use RFID to monitor concrete creep in bridges

Theres a company called CyPhy Works that is working on something like this, but only visual and not RFID.

Prior RFID has been all inside
We are taking it outside so it can be used in real world
Dealing with read angles, best way to mount it
Remove interference, or deal with it.
Designing real hardware platform to real world use

how high, how far can it be read
read success as function of x y z from tag
doppler shift from moving air from blades
dropping rfid sensor tag in volcano, fly over it

We are characterizing the performance of long range RFID tags outdoors.
