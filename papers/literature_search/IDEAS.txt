Ideas for Paper:

Could use RFID to monitor concrete creep in bridges

Prior RFID has been all inside
We are taking it outside so it can be used in real world
Dealing with read angles, best way to mount it
Remove interference, or deal with it.
Designing real hardware platform to real world use

how high, how far can it be read
read success as function of x y z from tag
doppler shift from moving air from blades
dropping rfid sensor tag in volcano, fly over it

We are characterizing the performance of long range RFID tags outdoors.
