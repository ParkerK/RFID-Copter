CARAMBOLA CONFIG
Notes for future package installation: Carambola architecture is MIPS, and can use RAMIPS/rt3883 IPK packages

* Start by compiling custom image with the following settings. Tutorial for setting up cross compile toolkit is here: http://www.8devices.com/wiki_carambola/doku.php/carambola_where_to_start
Note: Most of this probably isn't needed so we can start stripping packages out if we need more disk space, I was just trying to include everything I could here and it worked).

* use sysupgrade (http://www.8devices.com/wiki_carambola/doku.php/firmware_upgrade:sysupgrade) to reflash the Carambola

* reboot
 
* Connect via serial
	sudo screen /dev/ttyUSBX 115200

* Run the following to backup our current config.
	cd /etc/config
	cp dhcp dhcp_original
	cp firewall firewall_original
	cp network network_original
	cp wireless wireless_original

* Remove the old versions now as we will replace them.
	rm dhcp
	rm firewall
	rm network
	rm wireless

* Run the following. This auto generates a wireless script for us. It doesn't work, but I can use it to get the MAC address that needs to go in wireless (different from the one in the network file)
	wifi detect > /etc/config/wireless

* Look at the mac address that it auto detected, and write this down! It looks something like this:
	option macaddr	c4:93:00:11:18:48

* Now, put my updated networking configuration files in the correct locations. Either use USB or manually make new files with 'vi' and retype it all.
	dhcp goes in /etc/config
	firewall goes in /etc/config
	network goes in /etc/config
	wireless goes in /etc/config

* Open up the new /etc/config/wireless and replace the MAC address with the one you wrote down in step 4.

* The network you connect to is controlled in /etc/config/wireless. To change the ESSID edit that field in the wifi-iface declaration.

* Restart the Carambola
	reboot

* See if you have an ipaddress / if everything is working. iwconfig should not longer be blank and ifconfig should have an ip address.
	iwconfig
	ifconfig

* Now that internet is working we can use SCP and not have to retype files. First remove the old opkg.conf on the Carambola
	rm /etc/opkg.conf

* Now, copy over the new opkg.conf file. Make sure you are in the Carambola_Config directory on your computer, then run
	scp opkg.conf root@IP_ADDRESS_OF_CARAMBOLA:/etc/

* Update opkg
	opkg update

* Install python-mini
	opkg install python-mini

* Add threading.py to /root
	scp threading.py root@IP_ADDRESS_OF_CARAMBOLA:/root/

* Make sure it works
	python

* Install pyserial (but it won't work yet)
	opkg install http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_adjustment/12.09-beta/ramips/rt3883/packages/pyserial_2.4-1_ramips.ipk

* pyserial won't work yet though, it needs termios.so compiled for MIPS rt3883. I put this file in the Carambola_Config directory, so scp it into root on the Carambola
	scp termios.so root@IP_ADDRESS_OF_CARAMBOLA:/etc/

* Make sure pyserial is working now. This should run without any errors.
	python
	import serial

* Enable ttyS0 using this tutorial: http://www.8devices.com/wiki_carambola/doku.php/mmio_fixing_ttys0
	this is so we can connect the ArduPilot via serial.
	we can't just install 'io' the normal way, you must install it this way:	
	opkg install http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_adjustment/12.09-beta/ramips/rt3883/packages/io_1_ramips.ipk
	now you can follow the instructions starting at "Read to test". Make sure you add the correct number of 0's as this can really mess stuff up if you don't.  Also edit the /etc/inittab file.
	finally, make sure and etd the /etc/rc.local file so that this change happens everytime we start up
